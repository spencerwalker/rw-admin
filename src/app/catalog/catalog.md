## Catalog Component Overview

This component allows buyer users to view categories, sub-categories, and products assigned to them.

It uses the Me resource to list the correct data.

Catalog is a buyer perspective component, and can only be accessed when logged in as a buyer user, or when impersonating a buyer user.
